# RetroEventBus
Retrofit and EventBus combination

This is what they say(Eventbus): Less code, better quality. And you don't need to implement a single interface!

Most of us have recently started using Retrofit for REST API calls. So you all must be familiar with it. I have been doing some RnD since last few days and ended up writing a sample code(yes its completely written by me :P  there could be few issues but I made every attempt to make it easily understandable) which is a combo of Retrofit and Eventbus &  few other libs.

For further details on Events or Retrofit please follow the links at the bottom.

I have put most of the code here, a little effort would be required to put all these classes together and make necessary declarations to have an executable code.


Library dependencies:

1.  Retrofit 1.9.0

2.  Event Bus 2.4.0

3.  Butterknife 6.1.0 (for UI annotations)
